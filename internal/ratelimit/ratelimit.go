// Package ratelimit makes disgo wait out a 429 for as long as Discord says,
// not a whole second more.
//
// disgo reads a 429's wait from Retry-After, which Discord rounds up to
// whole seconds, so a 429 with 30ms left on it holds the bucket for a full
// second. tools/reactbench measured what that costs: Discord's per-user
// reaction limit draws a 429 every few birds, and each one cost a second,
// which was most of a fill. The 429's body carries the real wait,
// retry_after, to the millisecond.
